- ✨ Hi, I’m @plantsandcats 🌻😸
- 👀 I’m interested in humanitarian causes, community mutual aid initiatives, breaking out of the rat race.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and studying for my CompTIA+ Certification.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating an app for artists by artists and an app to track, monitor, and display how the Atlanta City Council spends and allocates its budget. I'm also into data visualization.
- 📫 How to reach me ... does this thing have direct messaging? lol.
